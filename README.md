<h2>HandwrittenDigitsMNist.m</h2>
-Utilizes nearest neighbor classification and euclidean distance to determine digit class and finds 5 falsely classified images for assessment.

<h2>MNistNoiseRescale.m</h2>
-Uses MNist images with added noise and scaling as a base for classification. Had to find/estimate rescale and noise values to correctly identify digits through least square distance, then compared results to simply using euclidean distance.
